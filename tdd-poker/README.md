# TDD practice
TDD is a *design process*, not a testing process. TDD is a robus way of designing software components ("units")
interactively so that their behaviour is specified through unit tests.

**Test-first cycle**

1. Write a simple failing test
2. Make the test pass by writing the minimum amount of code, don't bother with code quality
3. Refactor the code by applying design principles/patterns

## TDD Poker
Write a function to compare two poker hands:
```
function comparePokerHands(handOne, handTwo) {
  // code
}
```
